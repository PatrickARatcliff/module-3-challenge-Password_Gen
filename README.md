This web-application is designed to account for variables, in the generation of random passwwords. 

Variables may include numbers, lowercase letters, upper-caase letters, and/or special characters.

The application offers a series of prompts and confirmaations to determine the composition of the generated password. The passwword length must be between 8-128 character, least one variable must be picked.
 
 The html user interface includes a "Generate Password" button, which initializes the series of prompts. The password is cleared automatically, although a "Clear" button is included to reset the page.
